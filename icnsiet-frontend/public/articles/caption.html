            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>Image labeling is an interesting job whose goal is to automatically come up with words that describe what's in pictures. Cognitive computing has garnered attention in recent years because to its potential applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Our research aims to construct a complicated Image Caption Generator to assist individuals understand and define themselves. We achieve this using the CNN and LSTM models, two strong neural network architectures. CNN decodes in our system. It looks at the images you give it and pulls out important visual information that you need to understand what's in the pictures. It has been shown that the CNN is very good at finding patterns and things in pictures, which makes it a great part for extracting image features. LSTM, on the other hand, is a processor. It gets the extracted visual features from CNN and turns them into a text that makes sense and explains the picture content. The LSTM is good at this because it can handle data that comes in a certain order and understand how words depend on each other well. By combining CNN and LSTM, our model can easily combine the language knowledge with the visual information from the pictures to make subtitles that are correct and make sense in the given context. Our Image Caption Generator would be able to use this mixed method to include both basic visual details and complex philosophical ideas in the subtitles it creates. After making the captions, we use BLEU Scores to judge the quality of our model. The BLEU measure, which stands for "Bilingual Evaluation Understudy," is often used in NLP tasks to check how close created sentences are to reference sentences. It helps us figure out how well and how quickly our picture annotation system works. In conclusion, our Image Caption Generator is a useful tool for creating natural language descriptions of pictures. Our system can correctly and successfully write subtitles for a wide range of pictures by mixing the power of CNN and LSTM models. This technology has a lot of promise for many uses, such as helping people who are blind or have low vision, making picture search engines better, and making it easier to analyze video material.</p>

            <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>There are pictures all around us, on social media, and in the news all the time. People are the only ones who can recognize photos. Image recognition is something that people can do without words, but computers need to be taught how to do it first. Input vectors are used by the encoder-decoder design of picture caption generator models to make subtitles that are correct and relevant. Computer imaging, DL, and NLP are all brought together in this view. Before using a common language like English to describe something, you need to understand and know what the picture is about. Our strategy relies on CNN and LSTM models. The customized software employs CNN to encode and LSTM to decode text and add subtitles to acquire visual features. For example, image captioning can help the blind with text-to-speech by showing realtime information about the scene over a camera feed. It can also improve social medical pleasure by redoing labels for pictures in social feeds and spoken conversations. Helping kids name chemicals is a part of learning the language. Every picture on the internet should have a description. This would make it easier to find real photos and browse through them faster. Images with captions are used in biotechnology, business, the internet, and apps like self-driving cars (which can use them to describe the area around them) and CCTV cameras (which can set off alarms if they see anything suspicious). Simple DL explanations are the focus of this work.</p>

            <p>Labeling images requires computer vision and NLP. It is amazing progress in artificial intelligence for a machine to be able to write captions for pictures like a person can. The most important part of this work is showing how the things in the picture are connected in a language that people understand, like English. Within the past, computers have used predefined themes to create written titles for photos. But this method doesn't offer enough variety to make lexically rich text summaries. This flaw is no longer there because neural networks have become more useful. A lot of cutting-edge models use neural networks to make subtitles. They take pictures as input and guess the next word that will be used in the sentence as output.</p>

            <div class="figure-caption">Fig 1 Example Figure</div>

            <p>The project's goal is to turn a picture that is fed into it into a writing description. The project's goal is to use DL and NLP to find all the items and characteristics in a picture, figure out how they relate to each other, and then write subtitles that describe each feature. Building an image description generator is the main goal. This way, we can pick a random picture and have our model look at it and come up with some titles.</p>
